This is a test file with some referenced equations, line $$ this $$

Some equations might be inside of text, $$ for example $$ this one.

Some equations might be on start of paragraphs:

$$ start $$ of paragraph.

Other might be on separate paragraphs of their own:

$$ separate $$

Some of those can be labelled:

This is a test file with some referenced equations, line
$$ this \qquad(1)$$

Some equations might be inside of text, $$ for example \qquad(2)$$ this
one.

Some equations might be on start of paragraphs:

$$ start \qquad(3)$$ of paragraph.

Other might be on separate paragraphs of their own:

$$ separate \qquad(4)$$

Then they can be referenced:

Individually eq. 1, eq. 2, eq. 3, eq. 4

Or in groups eqns. 1, 2, 4

Groups will be compacted eqns. 1-4

Unknown references will print labels eqns. **¿eq:none?**, 1, 3, 4
